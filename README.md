# AllTreks

[Live site](http://all-treks.herokuapp.com/)


AllTreks is an AllTrails.com clone, where users can search for information about national, state, and local parks, as well as the trail systems within them.  Users are able to visit individual hike pages where they can access detailed information about the given trail, including distance, difficulty, elevation gain, route type, and a map of the area - as well as share their own experience with future users by leaving a review of the hike.   

AllTreks is built using the Ruby on Rails framework, a PostgreSQL database, and AWS S3 media storage for the backend.  The frontend of the site is built with React, using Redux to manage the frontend state and jQuery's $.ajax() function is used for all AJAX calls on the site.
